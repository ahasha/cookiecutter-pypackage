Cookiecutter_ template for a Python package. This was forked from: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage.

* GitHub repo: https://github.com/ahasha/cookiecutter-pypackage/
* Documentation: https://cookiecutter-pypackage.readthedocs.io/
* Free software: BSD license

Features
--------

Changes in fork reflect my preferences

* Adding docopt cli option (not tested)
* Removing unittest default in favor of pytest
* Adding a setup script and conda environment file
* Pulling setup script dependencies from requirements.txt by default
* Adding style checkers to dev dependencies

The following features are inherited from upstream

* Testing setup ``pytest``
* Travis-CI_: Ready for Travis Continuous Integration testing
* Tox_ testing: Setup to easily test for Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8
* Sphinx_ docs: Documentation ready for generation with, for example, `Read the Docs`_
* bump2version_: Pre-configured version bumping with a single command
* Command line interface using Click (optional)

Quickstart
----------

Install the latest Cookiecutter if you haven't installed it yet (this requires
Cookiecutter 1.4.0 or higher)::

    pip install -U cookiecutter

Generate a Python package project::

    cookiecutter https://github.com/ahasha/cookiecutter-pypackage.git

Then:

* Create a repo and put it there.
* Add the repo to your Travis-CI_ account.
* Install the dev requirements into a virtualenv. (``pip install -r requirements_dev.txt``)
* Register_ your project with PyPI.
* Run the Travis CLI command ``travis encrypt --add deploy.password`` to encrypt your PyPI password in Travis config
  and activate automated deployment on PyPI when you push a new tag to master branch.
* Add the repo to your `Read the Docs`_ account + turn on the Read the Docs service hook.
* Release your package by pushing a new tag to master.
* Add a ``requirements.txt`` file that specifies the packages you will need for
  your project and their versions. For more info see the `pip docs for requirements files`_.
* Activate your project on `pyup.io`_.

Not Exactly What You Want?

Don't worry, you have options:

Similar Cookiecutter Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage`_: The fabulous original template on which this for is based

* `Nekroze/cookiecutter-pypackage`_: A fork of the above with a PyTest test runner,
  strict flake8 checking with Travis/Tox, and some docs and ``setup.py`` differences.

* `tony/cookiecutter-pypackage-pythonic`_: Fork with py2.7+3.3 optimizations.
  Flask/Werkzeug-style test runner, ``_compat`` module and module/doc conventions.
  See ``README.rst`` or the `github comparison view`_ for exhaustive list of
  additions and modifications.

* `ardydedase/cookiecutter-pypackage`_: A fork with separate requirements files rather than a requirements list in the ``setup.py`` file.

* `lgiordani/cookiecutter-pypackage`_: A fork of Cookiecutter that uses Punch_ instead of bump2version_ and with separate requirements files.

* `briggySmalls/cookiecutter-pypackage`_: A fork using Poetry_ for neat package management and deployment, with linting, formatting, no makefiles and more.

* Also see the `network`_ and `family tree`_ for this repo. (If you find
  anything that should be listed here, please add it and send a pull request!)

Fork This / Create Your Own
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have differences in your preferred setup, I encourage you to fork this
to create your own version. Or create your own; it doesn't strictly have to
be a fork.

* Once you have your own version working, add it to the Similar Cookiecutter
  Templates list above with a brief description.

* It's up to you whether or not to rename your fork/own version. Do whatever
  you think sounds good.

Or Submit a Pull Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I also accept pull requests on this, if they're small, atomic, and if they
make my own packaging experience better.
